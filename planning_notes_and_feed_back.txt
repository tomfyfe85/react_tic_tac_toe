Planning:
1)Winning squares light up on a win and reset for the next game,


2)Players can enter names

3)There is a league table saving the scores of each game

4)There is a message when a draw occurs and the table resets

5)There is a a next game button

6) There is a league reset button (refresh the page)

7) The time travel bar stops counting after a each game/the old moves are cleared from the browser




// - Nice use of components 
// - Tests added, though not sure all of them are useful - think about testing from a user perspective, not implementation details 
// - Winning squares highlighted 
// - League table works 
// - Player names can be added and passed to league table

Improvements

// Would be nice if the winning lines cleared when a new game is started 
// Would be nice to have a message when the game is a draw or some handling of that case 
// A reset button would be nice instead of having to refresh the page or go back to Step 0

// In indexGame.js: 
// resetWinner / setResetWinner - unused code 
// const [resetWinner, setResetWinner] = useState(true); 
// was this going to be used in a feature that was never completed?

// In indexGame.js: 
// This seems like an odd pattern for updating the points state. This could have been approached in a cleaner way. 
// let { xState } = points; 
// xState += 1; 
// setPoints({ ...points, xState });

// In indexGame.js: 
// WhoStarts doesn't really seem to add anything except a random message? Would have been nice to see this impact functionality somehow/

// In indexWhoStarts.js and indexPlayer.js: 
// Compile error - React must be in scope when using JSX 
// import { useState } from "react" should be import React, { useState } from "react"

// In indexPlayer.js: 
// Created state twice for player names, once here and once in src/App/components/Game/indexGame.js 
// Could this have been done in one place and passed down as props?

// In indexPlayer.js: 
// Naming conventions 
// const NameHandler - JavaScript naming convention is camelCase so this should be nameHandler 
// indexWhoStarts.js - const HandleClick - same thing, should be handleClick

// In indexGame.js: 
// winningMove = winner[1]; 
// setWinning(winningMove); 
// Could have just been setWinning(winner[1])?
